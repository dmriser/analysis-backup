(1) Configure library path in your system for where the 
    library will be stored, in my case its an environment 
    variable called $h22libs.  You need to change the 
    SConstruct to import your environment variable.  Check 
    also the install.csh script to ensure that the object file 
    is moved and the header files are moved to your folder. 
    This location should be in your $LD_LIBRARY_PATH so c++
    can locate the shared object files at the run-time. 


(2) Run install.csh, this will compile fortran libraries first
    and then build the testModel.cxx code.  The install script 
    will also copy the .so and .f files to your specified libray 
    location.  

(3) Run the test code, use it as an example of how to include the 
    libraries using the extern"C" block at the top.
